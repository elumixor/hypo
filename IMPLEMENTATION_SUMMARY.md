# Character and Skills System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation addresses the P1 issue "4 characters, stats, skills, systems" by creating a comprehensive ability system with multiple components and services.

## 1. Character Definitions (`src/data/character-definitions.ts`)

### Four Unique Characters
- **Helios** (Attacker) - The protagonist, balanced warrior with adaptive AI
- **Kira** (Glass Cannon) - High-damage assassin with stealth abilities
- **Lucy** (Support) - Tech-mystic with healing and buff abilities  
- **Darius** (Tank) - Heavy defender with crowd control abilities

### Complete Ability Trees
Each character has 8 abilities:
- Basic Attack (light attack)
- Alt Attack (heavy attack)
- Block (defensive ability)
- Dash (movement ability)
- 4 Unique Skills (skill1-skill4)

### Upgrade System
- Each ability has a base configuration (damage, cooldown, energy cost, etc.)
- Upgrade nodes with prerequisites, costs, and free-form data
- Support for XP costs and special currency requirements

## 2. Character Status Service (`src/services/character-status.service.ts`)

### Character State Tracking
- Tracks character status: "not_met", "met", "in_party"
- Manages party composition (up to 4 characters)
- Tracks unlocked skills (skill1-skill4) per character
- Tracks upgrade progression for each ability

### Key Features
- Persistent save/load integration with GameStateService
- Event-driven architecture with EventEmitter
- Methods for: markCharacterMet(), addToParty(), unlockSkill(), unlockUpgrade()
- Blueprint system for finding and unlocking specific upgrades
- Prerequisite validation for upgrades

## 3. Runtime Combat Service (`src/services/runtime-combat.service.ts`)

### Centralized Combat Stats
- Manages current health, energy, dash charges for all party members
- Handles ability cooldowns and energy regeneration
- Tracks active character switching
- Real-time stat updates with event notifications

### Combat Mechanics
- Energy regeneration with delay after consumption
- Dash charge system with individual timers
- Ability usage validation (energy cost, cooldown checks)
- Character switching support

### Integration Points
- Replaces individual behavior stat management
- Provides unified API for all combat-related stats
- Event-driven updates for UI components

## 4. Updated Behaviors

### Health Behavior (`src/scenes/combat/behaviors/health.behavior.ts`)
- Bridges old entity-based system with new combat service
- Delegates to RuntimeCombatService for Player entities
- Maintains backward compatibility for non-character entities
- Event forwarding for UI compatibility

### Energy Behavior (`src/scenes/combat/behaviors/energy.behavior.ts`)
- Similar bridge pattern to Health Behavior
- Combat service handles regeneration logic
- Backward compatibility preserved

### Dash Behavior (`src/scenes/combat/behaviors/dash.behavior.ts`)
- Movement/animation logic retained in behavior
- Charge management delegated to combat service
- Configuration retrieved from character definitions
- Event forwarding for UI updates

### Shield Behavior (`src/scenes/combat/behaviors/shield.behavior.ts`)
- Updated to use combat service for energy consumption
- Collision handling and visual effects preserved
- Energy drain calculation maintained

## 5. Updated UI (`src/scenes/combat/ui/player-stats.widget.ts`)

### Combat Service Integration
- Listens to RuntimeCombatService events instead of individual behaviors
- Updates for health, energy, and dash charges
- Active character switching support
- Maintains visual styling and responsive scaling

## 6. Game Integration (`src/game.ts`)

### Service Registration
- CharacterStatusService added to global services
- RuntimeCombatService added to global services
- Proper initialization order maintained

### Save/Load Integration
- CharacterStatusState added to game state
- Persistent storage for character progression
- GameStateService updated with new state management

## Key Design Decisions

### Service-Based Architecture
- Centralized stat management in services instead of entity behaviors
- Event-driven communication between services and UI
- Clean separation of concerns

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing behavior APIs preserved
- Non-character entities continue to work with old system
- Gradual migration path for future improvements

### Data-Driven Design
- Character definitions as pure data structures
- Configurable base stats and abilities
- Extensible upgrade system

### Minimal Code Changes
- Existing game functionality preserved
- UI components updated with minimal changes
- Build system and dependencies unchanged

## Future Extension Points

### Character Switching
- Foundation for party-based gameplay
- Active character management in place
- UI ready for character selection

### Skill Progression
- Upgrade unlock system implemented
- XP and currency support
- Prerequisites validation

### Ability System
- Cooldown and energy cost framework
- Base for implementing actual skill effects
- Event system for ability usage tracking

## Testing and Validation

### Build Verification
- Project compiles successfully with TypeScript
- No runtime errors in development mode
- All services properly registered and initialized

### Code Quality
- Biome linting passed
- TypeScript strict checking enabled
- Event memory management with proper cleanup

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the character and skills system while maintaining compatibility with existing game code. The modular design allows for easy extension and enhancement of individual components.
